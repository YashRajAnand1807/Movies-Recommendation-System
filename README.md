# Movies-Recommendation-System
 It is a Batch-Learning model. The model is based on a context-based prediction model. I have used the data of TMDB and  trained my module on the basis of that data. I have used cosine distance and vectorization concepts to find the similarity  between movies and predicted according to them.
